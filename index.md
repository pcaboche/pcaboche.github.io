    <a id="python-awk-perl-julia" href="https://github.com/pcaboche/article/blob/main/en/data-engineering/python-awk-perl-julia/python-awk-perl-julia.pdf"><b><i>Python, AWK, Perl, Julia: Processing large data files</i></b></a><br>
    <i>"How to process large data files easily?"</i><br>
    This is the question we are trying to answer, by comparing 4 scripting languages, based on different criteria (features, syntax, performance, ease of use).
    For our tests, we take a large data file and try to put that data in different "buckets" based on some conditions.<br>

### LaTeX

<ul>
    <li>
    <a id="latex-cjk-ruby" href="https://github.com/pcaboche/article/blob/main/en/latex/CJK-pinyin-furigana/latex-CJK-pinyin-furigana.pdf"><b><i>LaTeX: rendering texts in Japanese and Chinese</i></b></a><br>
    This article explains how to handle non-Latin writing systems in LaTeX, with a focus on Japanese and Chinese.<br>
    It also explains how to add <i>pinyin</i>, <i>furigana</i>, and other <i>ruby</i> characters (i.e. the annotations on top of <i>kanji</i> characters, and usually used to indicate the pronunciation or to remove ambiguity). <br>
    The article also focuses on portability. The solutions presented should be both free, and compatible with multiple systems: Windows, Linux, etc.<br>
