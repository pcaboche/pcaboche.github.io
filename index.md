    <i>"How to process large data files easily?"</i><br>
    This is the question we are trying to answer, by comparing 4 scripting languages, based on different criteria (features, syntax, performance, ease of use).
    For our tests, we take a large data file and try to put that data in different "buckets" based on some conditions.<br>

    <br>
    This article will guide you in your journey with LaTeX: from installation, rendering your first document... to the different components that may be needed for writing a detailed article or even a thesis (e.g. cross-references, quotes, bibliography, index, etc).
    All of these topics are conveniently compiled in one document, and presented in a way that is easy to follow. <br>
    The article also highlights some of the strengths of LaTeX, and the workflows that can make you more productive.<br>

    <i>32 pages, 11<sup>th</sup> July 2022</i><br>
    <br>
    This article explains how to handle non-Latin writing systems in LaTeX, with a focus on Japanese and Chinese.<br>
    It also explains how to add <i>pinyin</i>, <i>furigana</i>, and other <i>ruby</i> characters (i.e. the annotations on top of <i>kanji</i> characters, and usually used to indicate the pronunciation or to remove ambiguity). <br>
    The article also focuses on portability. The solutions presented should be both free, and compatible with multiple systems: Windows, Linux, etc.
